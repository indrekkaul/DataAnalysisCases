# Bike Share Case Study

## Introduction
This project analyzes the differences in usage patterns between casual riders and annual members of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company.

## Scenario
The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
Therefore, I want to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, I need to design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, 
Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
The director has assigned to me the first question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Ask
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Whay would casual riders buy annual membership?
